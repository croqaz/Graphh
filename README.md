# graphH (WIP)

Graph experiments & playground.


This is basically a ... [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph).

Why directed? Because all things in real life have a direction.

* because "the back of the front" is not the same as "the front of the back"
* because "doing things right" is not the same as "doing the right things"
* because "doing what you like" is not the same as "liking what you do"

The graph is like a spiderweb. But you can also think of it like a maze.


Don't touch, yet. It breaks.
